# Python-Encoder-Decoder-GUI
We all use this system everyday, well I mean, it is more advanced, but the basic ideas is similar, there is a message and a key.
Let's understand this with an example, let's say you got a message from your bank, stating your balance, if the sms was un-encrypted, it would be disaster, because anyone can see the message if he/she has access to your network, so what is the solution, there are actually two messages, one with the encrypted message, which doesn't make any sense, and the other is the key, you guessed it correct, it can decrypt the main message, but both messages are not sent together, there is a gap of few milliseconds, so that the person into your network is not served the key with the encrypted message. Usually the key is in the form of matrix, converted using ASCII, and the main message is too converted to a matrix using ASCII, and both the key matrix and the message matrix are multiplied, to get the encrypted message, to get the decrypted message, they are divided, all of that happens in micro seconds, on our phones, isn't that cool?
